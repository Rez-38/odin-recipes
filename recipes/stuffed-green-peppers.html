                <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, chopped</li>
                <li>½ cup water</li>
                <li>½ cup uncooked rice</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed tomato soup</li>
                <li>water as needed</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Step</li>
                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cut the tops off bell peppers and remove the seeds. Cook bell peppers in boiling water for 5 minutes; drain. Sprinkle salt inside each bell pepper and set aside.
                <li>Step</li>
                Place ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until beef is browned, about 5 minutes. Drain off excess fat and season with salt and pepper. Stir in tomatoes, 1/2 cup water, rice, and Worcestershire sauce; reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cheese.
                <li>Step</li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                <li>Step</li>
                Stuff each bell pepper with beef and rice mixture; arrange open-side up in a baking dish.
                <li>Step</li>
                Combine tomato soup with just enough water in a medium bowl to make the soup a gravy consistency; pour over the bell peppers and cover with aluminum foil.
                <li>Step</li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese is melted and bubbly, about 25 to 30 minutes.
